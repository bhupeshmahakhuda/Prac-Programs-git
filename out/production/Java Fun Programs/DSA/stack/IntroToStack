LIFO order.
We use stack in web browser history, for example in browser
first I have visited to youtube, then on the same page I go to udemy link, then I opened FB.
if I am trying to back from FB I will go to udemy then again by pressing back button I will go to youtube.

THIS IS STACK!!!

O(1) = for adding and removing last item.
O(n) = for adding and removing the first item.
